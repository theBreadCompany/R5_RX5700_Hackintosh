# Ryzen 5 RX 5700 Hackintosh

## Your work
If your build is really __this__ similiar to mine, you have almost no work left, except creating [your own SMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) and [enter your own ROM](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#fixing-rom) (your Ethernet MAC address).

## Disclaimer
Feel free to use this repostory fully or as a part of your own Hackitnosh build, however I do not take any responsibility for the hardware damage that may occur. 

## Hardware
- AMD Ryzen 5 2600
- Sapphire Pulse Rx 5700
- ASUS Prime B450-Plus
- 16 GB Corsair Vengeance (non-RGB)
- Samsung Evo 860 250 GB
- A random harddrive
- USB-DAC for mic support as Hackintoshs with AMD mainboard dont have mic support
